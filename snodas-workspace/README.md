# SnodasWorkspace ##

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 9.0.2.

## Development server ##

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Currently Installed `npm` Packages ##


This section contains the currently installed `npm` packages, what they do, and what
version they are at. A package will be flagged under its name if its purpose is unknown,
so that the appropriate action can be done, such as figuring out what it's doing, or
removing the package.

The reason this section was created (and why it will be created for any Angular project
in the future), is because as more and more third-party libraries are relied on for a
project, the higher the chances for upgrade issues, security vulnerabilities, code
abandonment, etc. This way the packages can be viewed and scrutinized at any time, and
more thought and care can go into installing them for project use.

This table contains the following:

* **Package Name** - The name of the installed `npm` package. Will contain **POSSIBLE DELETION**
if the package might be able to be removed, but more information is needed.
* **Description** - A description of the package and what it does for the project.
* **Angular Installed** - Whether Angular installed the package automatically. These will
need to be updated only when updating Angular using `npx`.
* **Version** - The current version the installed package.
