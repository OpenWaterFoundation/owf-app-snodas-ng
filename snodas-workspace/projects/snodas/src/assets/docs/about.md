### Daily SNODAS Snowpack Products for Colorado Water Supply Basins ###

This website provides access to a historical archive of SNODAS data products for Colorado water
supply basins. Snow Data Assimilation System (SNODAS) data from the
<a href="https://www.nohrsc.noaa.gov/interactive/html/map.html">National Operational Hydrologic Remote Sensing Center (NOHRSC)</a>
are processed daily to calculate Snow Water Equivalent (SWE)
and Snow Coverage statistics for water supply basins in Colorado. Snow Water Equivalent is the
estimate of the depth of liquid water contained within the snowpack. Snow coverage is a percent
of the basin land surface covered by snow (water bodies in the basin are ignored). The national
SNODAS gridded dataset is processed to provide data products for Colorado. Mean SWE is
displayed in the map using a legend similar to the National Weather Service. The SNODAS Tools
website provides access to an archive of daily products.

#### View Daily Data ####

* Hover over a basin to see the daily mean SWE value and other daily statistics.
* Reposition the map by holding the mouse button down and dragging.
* Zoom in and out of the map using the control in the upper left, or use the mouse wheel.
* Click a basin on the map to select a basin or use ***Select Basin*** to select from the basin list.
The basin outline will be shown as a thick gray outline.
* Click on buttons in ***SNODAS Data Graphs*** area to display data graphs.
* Once a graph has been opened, use the ***Close*** button to close the graph view and return
to the main screen.

#### View Animation ####

* To view an animation, click on ***SNODAS Animation*** to display the animation controls.
* Enter the period to animate using the ***Enter start date*** and ***Enter end date*** text fields.
The tooltip in these entry fields shows supported date formats.
* Optionally, also enter the increment, which defines the spacing in days for animation steps.
* Press the play button to view the animation of daily SWE data.
* Use the pause and reset buttons to control the animation.

#### Download Data ####

* Use the ***Data*** menu for information about accessing data files.
* Use the map to determine basin identifiers and substitute in the example URLs.
